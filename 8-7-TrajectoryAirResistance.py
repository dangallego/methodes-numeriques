Exercise 8.7: Trajectory with air resistance
Many elementary mechanics problems deal with the physics of objects moving or flying through the air, but they almost always ignore friction and air resistance 
to make the equations solvable. If we're using a computer, however, we don't need solvable equations.
Consider, for instance, a spherical cannonball shot from a cannon standing on level ground. The air resistance on a moving sphere is a force in the opposite direction 
to the motion with magnitude

F = \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2\rho C v^2,

where R is the sphere's radius, rho is the density of air, v is the velocity, and C is the so-called coefficient of drag (a property of the shape of the moving object, in this case a sphere).

    Starting from Newton's second law, F = ma, show that the equations of motion for the position (x, y) of the cannonball are

    \ddot{x} = - {\pi R^2\rho C\over2m}\, \dot{x}\sqrt{\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2},
    \ddot{y} = - g - {\pi R^2\rho C\over2m}\, \dot{y}\sqrt{\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2},

    where m is the mass of the cannonball, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and \dot{x} and \ddot{x} are the first and second derivatives of x with respect to time.
    Change these two second-order equations into four first-order equations using the methods you have learned, then write a program that solves the equations for a 
    cannonball of mass 1 kg and radius 8 cm, shot at 30ยบ to the horizontal with initial velocity 100 ms-1. The density of air is rho = 1.22 kg m-3 and the coefficient of 
    drag for a sphere is C = 0.47. Make a plot of the trajectory of the cannonball (i.e., a graph of y as a function of x).
    When one ignores air resistance, the distance traveled by a projectile does not depend on the mass of the projectile. In real life, however, mass certainly does make 
    a difference. Use your program to estimate the total distance traveled (over horizontal ground) by the cannonball above, and then experiment with the program to 
    determine whether the cannonball travels further if it is heavier or lighter. You could, for instance, plot a series of trajectories for cannonballs of different masses,
      or you could make a graph of distance traveled as a function of mass. Describe briefly what you discover.
